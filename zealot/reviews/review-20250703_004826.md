**Branch:** feature/nuvo1  
**Timestamp:** 20250703 004826  
**Reviewed Files:** .github/workflows/test-whisper-transcribe.yaml

## Overview

This is an AI-generated review of the code produced by DevOpsZealot.

## Requirements Analysis

The code was generated based on these requirements:
- IMPORTANT: Create ONLY ONE file: a GitHub Actions workflow file at the exact path '.github/workflows/test-whisper-transcribe.yaml'
- DO NOT create any other files like output.sh or similar
- The workflow must be a properly formatted GitHub Actions YAML file
- The workflow should run on push to the feature/nuvo1 branch when whisper_mp4_transcript.sh changes
- The workflow should also run on pull requests to main/master branches
- Allow manual workflow dispatch with an option for debug logging
- Configure the workflow to run on ubuntu-latest
- Set up the environment with Python 3.10 using actions/setup-python@v5
- Install FFmpeg and Whisper dependencies
- Test the whisper_mp4_transcript.sh script with input/test-meeting.mp4
- Use a small Whisper model (tiny) to make the test faster
- Output the transcript to test-output/test-meeting.txt
- Verify that the transcript was generated correctly
- Upload the transcript as an artifact for review using actions/upload-artifact@v4
